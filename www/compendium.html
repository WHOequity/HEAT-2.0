<p>The following table provides a brief definition of the RMNCH indicators currently available in the <a href="http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.HE-1540?lang=en" target="_blank">WHO Health Equity Monitor database</a> (2016 update). Detailed information about the criteria used to calculate the numerator and denominator values for each indicator are available in the indicator compendium or in the WHO Indicator and Measurement Registry, under the topic Health Equity Monitor (<a href="http://www.who.int/gho/indicator_registry/en/" target="_blank">www.who.int/gho/indicator_registry/en/</a>).</p>
