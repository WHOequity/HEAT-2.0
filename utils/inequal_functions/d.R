######### Rate Difference (RD)
# The rate difference is used to measure the extent to which one group is better (or worse) off than another group.  It is 
# implemented here in a way that ignores an a priori ordering and selects the two groups (from 2 plus groups) that have
# the best and worst outcomes.
